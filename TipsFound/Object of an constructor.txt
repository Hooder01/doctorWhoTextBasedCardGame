If you're passing an contrustor objects 

make sure all the data you have get's values 

for example 

I defined 5 int types 

then gave them new object names

now I try and call that constructor object however Iv'e only given 4 interger whole numbers 

this results in E0289 despite asking for a constuctor you already have
